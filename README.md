Overview
--------

**displacement_locations_unhcr.csv** is a global dataset from the UNHCR
Field Information and Coordination Support Section (FICSS). This dataset
encompasses the universe of refugee, returnee, IDP, and asylum seeker
locations that the UNHCR is aware of (even if they are not actively
working in these locations), and it includes historic and currently open
sites. The earliest recorded locations are from 1966, and the data was
last updated by FICSS on January 6, 2020.

To construct these data, UNHCR country teams and field staff report the
location of any known displaced communities to FICSS.

With the help of a team of research assistants, we manually validated
and corrected refugee and IDP locations that were open during our study
period from 1990–2018. Outside of this time span, we have not made
corrections.

Thus, we share this dataset on Github not only to provide researchers
with global data on historic and current displacement locations, but
also to make this a “living dataset,” where experts can send us
corrections and where the most updated version is always publicly
available.
